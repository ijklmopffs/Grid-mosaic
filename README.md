# Grid-mosaic

This website shows what is possible using grid in CSS. Grid is used to create a mosaic website, giving the website a beautiful look, while showing what grid in CSS is able to achieve. The webiste was a codalong with Jen Kramer from Frontend Masters, and building alongside her was a wonderful experience. She gave explanations for why certain things where the way the were in the course and I am grateful for that.
